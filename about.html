                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>After a 14-year career as a college basketball coach, I transitioned into a career as a Software Engineer/Web Developer. After over a year of self-learning & gaining around 40 online certificates through passing courses, I enrolled & completed a full-stack coding boot-camp which propelled me into a tech residency program as one of two developers working with a team creating an amazing website & progressive web app. I've leveraged my coaching background to quickly adapt to new technologies & meet project requirements effectively. With a strong foundation in leadership, teamwork, creative problem solving, and exceptional communication, I thrive in collaborative environments, contributing to the success of the team with dedication and efficiency. I am not part of a startup company, GenAI Consulting where I am the full stack web developer. I also have my own freelance web development business, The Web Guardian, where I design websites from top to bottom for clients. After no freedom for 14 years in my previous career I am absolutely loving remote work as a web developer!
