                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>I am originally from Louisiana. I grew up in a home with my mother and brother. I moved away when I graduated from High School to take advantage of a college basketball scholarship I earned. 
                        After graduating from college I worked for Anheuser-Busch for a few years in marketing and sales before pursuing my dream of becoming a college basketball coach. 
                        I had the privilege of coaching college basketball for 14 years before I decided to step away to pursue a new dream in software engineering.

            <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>I have a 5 year old miniature bernedoodle named Sebastyan. He and I both enjoy going on walks and being outside. 
                        I like sports, particularly basketball and football. I work out 5 days a week doing a variety of things; biking on the peloton, mountain biking outside, walking, hiking, lifting weights,
                        and recently I have gotten into pilates. I am passionate about traveling and seeing new places. Every summer I take my mom on a cruise.
